%% Generalized Hough Transform: (see 2B-L3)

  If orientation is known:
    1- For each edge point; compute gradient direction (theta), retreive 
    displacement vectors (r) to vote for reference point.
    2- Peak in this hough space (X,Y) isreference point with most supporting 
    edges.
    
   If orientation is unkown:
    1- For each edge point;
    for each possible master(theta*), compute the gradient direction (theta)
    new theta' = theta-theta*
    for theta', retreive displacement vectors to vote for reference point.
    
    Peaks in the Hough space (X,Y, theta*) is reference point with most 
    supporting edges
    
    Same can be done for scale(S) if scale is unknown


%% Application in recognition:


training images:
  Instead of indexing displacements by gradientorientation, index by 
  "visual codeword"
  
  1- Build codebook of patches around extracted interst points using clustering
  2- Map the patch around each interest point to closest codebook entry
  3- For each codebook entry, store all displacements relative to object center
