Fourier transform and convolution:
  Convolution in spacial domain is the same as a multiplication in frequency domain.
  Important in aliasing.
  multiplication in the spacial domain is a convolution in frequency domain
   for faster processing, instead of doing a convolution I can apply a FFT to my spacial function, 
   and multiply the result. applying an inverse fourier transform would give the result of the convolution.
   
   Do not cut out the high frequency in the frequency domain, it will give out a ringing.
