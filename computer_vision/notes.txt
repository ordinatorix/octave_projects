This document contains the note from my computer vision class

----------------- 1A_L1 -------------------

Definitions:
Computer Photography(CP): is using the hardware to camture an image
Computer Vision (CV): using a computer to interpret the contents of a picture

Forms of computer vision:
Object Recognition, Face recongnition, 3D modeling, 

Kinect can produce depth images and skeleton image

-----------------

Vision is Not image Processing
- the famous checkered board in shadow example, A&B are the same intensity
- seeing is not the same as measuring properties of an image
- seeing is building a percept of what is in the world based upon the measurements made by an imaging sensor.
